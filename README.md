# InvestigatingMovies-GuestStars
Investigating Movies and Guest Stars in The Office

These projects are from the Datacamp course https://app.datacamp.com/learn/projects/entertainment-data 

In these  projects, I will apply the skills I have learned in Python courses through Datacamp to solve a real-world data science problem. I will investigate if  Netflix movies are getting shorter over time and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of “The Office”. This is achieved using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.

This project helps me gain experience in an essential data science skill — exploratory data analysis. This allows me to perform critical tasks such as manipulating raw data and drawing conclusions from plots I create of the data.
